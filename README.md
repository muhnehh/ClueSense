# DODO - AI-Powered Internship Simulator

[![Vibe Code Camp](https://img.shields.io/badge/Built%20at-Vibe%20Code%20Camp-orange)](https://openeconomy.xyz/vibecodecamp)

## Overview

DODO is an innovative AI-powered platform designed to simulate real-world internships at top tech companies like Google, Meta, Microsoft, Netflix, and Amazon (FAANG). It provides aspiring developers and students with hands-on experience in coding challenges, system design, behavioral interviews, and mentorship—without the risk of rejection. By leveraging AI mentors, mock data, and realistic project environments, DODO helps users build genuine skills, track progress, and prepare for actual FAANG interviews.

Built during the [Vibe Code Camp](https://openeconomy.xyz/vibecodecamp) program, this prototype demonstrates a full-stack internship matcher and simulator. It focuses on core features like interactive coding sessions (e.g., implementing an LRU Cache), AI-driven feedback, progress dashboards, and simulated live interviews.

**Tagline:** Practice at FAANG companies without the rejection.

## Key Features

- **AI-Powered Simulations**: Dive into authentic internship tasks, such as Google SWE projects on data structures and algorithms, with timed challenges and mock data.
- **AI Mentorship**: Get instant, personalized feedback on code, optimizations, and explanations. Ask questions via voice or text—e.g., "How do I optimize this sorting algorithm?"
- **Code Analysis & Feedback**: Real-time evaluation of time complexity (e.g., O(n log n) for quicksort), code quality scores (up to 92%), and improvement suggestions.
- **Progress Dashboard**: Track skills in Data Structures & Algorithms (e.g., 92%), System Design (85%), and Behavioral Interviews (91%). Monitor projects completed, mentorship hours (42h+), and interview readiness (94%).
- **Live Interview Simulations**: Practice with AI interviewers trained on FAANG questions, scoring sessions (e.g., 8.5/10), and detailed debriefs.
- **Real Projects & Undetectable Skills**: Work on production-ready features mirroring real internships. Skills developed are genuine—no fake experience, just confidence for resumes and interviews.
- **CV Review & Career Tools**: Upload your resume for AI analysis, get career roadmaps, and join a community of builders.
- **Flexible Pricing Tiers**: Free Starter plan, $49/month Professional (with human mentors), and custom Enterprise options.

DODO adapts to your learning style, ensuring undetectable, real-world competence that shines in actual hiring processes.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (with potential integrations like Chart.js for dashboards).
- **Backend/Logic**: Simulated with Python (e.g., for LRU Cache implementation) and AI APIs for mentorship.
- **Deployment**: Hosted on GitHub Pages for easy access to the demo landing page.
- **AI Integration**: Conceptual use of tools like Grok or similar for code analysis and voice assistance.
- **Other Tools**: Voice recognition for queries, progress tracking with local storage.

This MVP was prototyped rapidly using AI coding tools (e.g., Bolt, v0) to focus on user acquisition and validation.

## Getting Started

This is a static demo hosted on GitHub Pages. No setup required—just view the live site!

1. **View the Demo**: Visit [your-username.github.io/dodo](https://your-username.github.io/dodo) (replace with your actual repo URL).
2. **Interact with Features**:
   - Try the LRU Cache challenge: Implement the `put` method in the provided class.
   - Ask the AI Mentor: "What's the time complexity issue in my get method?"
   - Simulate an interview: Walk through a system design question.
3. **Join the Waitlist**: Sign up via the form to get updates on full launch.
4. **Run Locally** (if forking):
   - Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/dodo.git`
   - Open `index.html` in a browser.
   - For interactive code: Use the embedded editor (e.g., Monaco or CodeMirror).

**Note**: Full interactivity (e.g., AI responses, test running) requires backend integration—currently simulated for demo purposes.

## Roadmap

- **Short-Term**: Integrate real AI APIs for mentorship (e.g., OpenAI for code review).
- **Medium-Term**: Add user authentication, save progress to backend (e.g., Firebase).
- **Long-Term**: Launch mobile app, partner with more companies, and offer certified badges.

Inspired by the Vibe Code Camp ethos: Turn ideas into reality in 2 weeks, validate with users, and ship MVPs that get traction.

## Contributing

Contributions welcome! This started as a Vibe Code Camp project, but let's make it better:

1. Fork the repo.
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`).
3. Commit changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`).
4. Push to branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`).
5. Open a Pull Request.

Focus areas: Bug fixes in simulations, new challenge additions, UI polish.
